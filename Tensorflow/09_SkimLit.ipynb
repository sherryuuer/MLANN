    "### 项目概要\n",
    "\n",
    "实质上是一种Seq2seq的模型，将医学论文的摘要进行总结的模型。将每一个段落或者句子，进行总结描述，是哪一种内容，也是一种多分类问题。\n",
    "\n",
    "SkimLit 使用迁移学习的方法，通过微调预训练的语言模型（如BERT或RoBERTa）来进行科学文献的摘要生成。它的训练数据通常包括科学期刊中的摘要-全文对，以及额外的摘要摘要对，以便进行监督学习。\n",
    "\n",
    "SkimLit 的应用领域主要集中在科学研究和学术出版领域，帮助研究人员更有效地处理和理解大量的学术文献，以便快速获取信息和洞见。\n",

    "该项目使用的[数据集](https://github.com/Franck-Dernoncourt/pubmed-rct.git)是已经被分割标注好了的数据，很干净，但是实际上如果自己做的话需要很多的前置工作。"
